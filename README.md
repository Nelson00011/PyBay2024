## Resources & Notes:

<h3>Improve with Python </h3>
<h5>Pamela Fox</h5>

- linked to github repo [here](https://pamelafox.github.io/improv-with-python/)
- Improve with Python... fun, interactive talk using language models.


<h3>Data Science: Apache Arrow, Pandas and Parquet</h3>

Datasources -> Data Collection -> Data storage & Transofrmation
- Telegraf open source injection agents is great agent? Influx or ParK files or "output plug ins": Look at the slide deck in file... 
- SQl Aggregatoin fx  - DB3.0 Apache Data Query Engineer noSQL using SQL language? Google Later? 
- Telegraf? Dispatched Q and stream the data? 
- PyArrow - python version of Apache Arrow for the data format transfer...
- Apache Parquet - look into...
- Apache Arrow - data analytics and tooling and basics, standard... columnar data format - CPU and GPU architecture? 
- Flight (arrow) vs Flight SQL (superset: ORM's UI builders)
- Looking at NOAA for jupiter notebook that can be examined for changes overtime...output only, not the input or inducing factors...
   Prophet - weather forestcasting (combines seasons, holidays, etc..) Time series pitfalls... look up later
Solution: Apache Arrow allows data transfer with ease (centralized system to plug into other databases)


<h3>Data Science: Raising Python Quality in AI orgs</h3>

- AI driven expert platform - look at raw slide deck at EoD
    - AI vs Quantum Computering
    - Open Source vs Recommender Library: Recommended approproaches, Item-Scorer, Estimator 
- Data Science / AI practitioners:
    - Analyst, Data Scientist, Machine Learning (MLE), Software Engineer... 
- SEEDS: biweekly workshop for improving data science practitioners - defining consistent standards or terminology? 
    - isaac_storch@intuit.com (volunteering?)
- Python tooling and automation 
    - Services: Rest, GraphQL, AI orch; Lambdas:; Machine Learning Models: Scikit xgboost, Tensor flow, PyTortch?
Poetry may or not be one tool to solve everything? PyPI


<h3>Automate City Data: Python</h3>

- Philip James: phildini@phildini.net 
- Involved in multiple companies: Crowdalert.com , etc... 


<h3>Pyscript</h3>
<h5>Fabio Pliger & Chris Laffra</h5>

- PyScript [QR Code link](https://fpliger.pyscriptapps.com/talks-pybay-2024/latest/)
- Platform that allows you to write proper python? 
- Concern about bandwidth, security, 
- Start with [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/)

``` <script type="mpy" scr-"./main.py" config="./pyscript.toml"></script> ```
- alternative version

``` <script type="mpy" scr-"./main.py" worker async></script> ```

- Python editor element as well, LTK newer framework based on JQuery, PuePy?, BeeWare?, React Pyscript, Tufts has been using Pyscript this last year?


<h3>13 Fun Facts about Pythons</h3>

- update accordingly? 
- Email: allardbrain@gmail.com


<h3>Topic Model By Search</h3>

- Clean up documents more, 
- ElasticSearch, get slide deck online? 
- Embedding for that topic and store it in the cache? 
- Training topic models, use case matter... localized topic embeddings improve results, 
- kas@joinunified.us or .com? 


<h3> Accelerating ML Prototyping</h3>
<h5>Parul Gupta</h5>

- Production Engineer, Meta 
- ML Lifestyle: project, ML Prototyping[dataengineering/ML model development]/[mointoring/analysis], Deployment
- Jupyter notebooks: Language agonistic, Backend, 
- Conda developed by Anaconda package management: lower learning curve? Model delivery can more freely play with github projects
- Bento - internalized for Meta based on code bases within Meta? 


<h3>Teaching Python?</h3>

- Motivates learning and deeper understanding 
- Keep it Simple Silly & Bloom's Taxonomy: Remember > Understand > Apply > Analyze > Evaluate > Create
- Big Data is a potential concern? 


<h3>Improve Part 2: Systems</h3>

- PyTest: Testing code is incredibly important...
- Test Automation Period?: Unit, Service, Browser


<h3>Practical GraphRAG: LLMs with Knowledge Graphs</h3>
<h5>Allison Cossette</h5>

- Retrieval augmented generation & graph databases
- Neo4j: Nodes, Relationships, Properties
- GraphRAG with Neo4j, Text2Cypher, GraphVector, GraphFiltering, AgentsAndMulti-Step, GraphContextVectorSearch
- Starting Tips: Start small, data quality, draw data with arrows, 
- Webtool for establishing data in database Neo4j LLM Knowledge Graph Builder & Extract Nodes and Relationships from Unstructured [Text](https://neo4j.com/labs/genai-ecosystem/llm-graph-builder/)


<h3>Pyre, Lints, Codemods, Code Quality, and you</h3>
<h5>Maggie Moss</h5>

- 5 Steps to improve code quality: Identify problem, Get Metrics, Find Stakeholders & Team up, Automated or Educate, Protect your progress / Stop the bleed
    - Documentation for clarity: make sure to use clear, direct documentation that is user friendly and explict. 
- Why Types? 
    - Updated documentation when you make changes, take 5 minutes when you update it, instead of being confused or confusing other's later
- PyType, Mypy, PyCharm, Pyre, Pyright
- Leverage Tools: Pyre Infer, MonkeyType, Pyannotate
- Coverage Goals: Return annotation, strict files, removeing error suppression, removing any
